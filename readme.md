# Deux 
> Deux was developed to be a custom solution for compiling C++ code on an external server, providing command line feedback in real-time whilst monitoring file changes and automatically (re)compiling. 

Developed with bare simplicity in mind, Deux provides a build server system for C++ that monitors a target folder, automatically compiling when it detects any changes and executes compiled programs to provide you real-time feedback through the command line to assist in rapid development.

Deux was developed as a custom solution for my personal needs, not as a public tool; the codebase however, may be of use to others.
